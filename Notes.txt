Tanuj's questions:
Two approaches:
    1. Canvas 
        1 div for the board, shapes will go inside Canvas
    2. Each block is a div
        capturing state of each black (ie filled or unfilled)
    3. HTML Table
    4. HTML Grid

    HTML Table

Rotations:
    Rotation = Transpose + Reflect
    T-shape
